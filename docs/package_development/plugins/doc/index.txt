Documentation for plugins
=========================

The documentation of a plugin must be included in the **docs/** folder of the plugin. :doc:`The documentation is written in reStructuredText format and will be build with sphinx <sphinx>`.

Thanks to sphinx, you can choose the way (and url) to generate your plugin documentation. But we suggest you to use `the ReadTheDocs.org <http://readthedocs.org>` (RTD) online service. It offers several usefull features: 

* documentation is hosted by RTD
* you can easily manage separate documentation for each versio of your plugin
* documentation can be build on each commit pushed on a Github repository
* the built documentation is really clear and easy to read
