==========================================================
Plugins json file upgrade from version 1 to json version 2
==========================================================

Purpose
=======
This document describes the step to follow for upgrading the plugin json file from version 1 to 2.
With json version 2 the url2xpl and the stats xml files are deprecated, the content of these files are moved to the plugin json file (*sensors* and *commands* parts).
This document only describes how to upgrade.

    * give more details

.. note::

    Please notice that this page is mainly for information. To migrate your plugin json file from *version 1* (Domogik 0.3) to *version 2* (Domogik 0.4+) you should check also all the other pages related to the **info.json** file!

Configuration part
==================

The following keys had been removed:

* *id* : just define the options in the appropriate order in the table
* *interface* (as now the way of handling multiple devices will change)

In the json file, the following keys are renamed:

* startup-plugin => auto_startup. And this key is also removed! You don't need to add it in the json anymore, it is dynamically added by Domogik as all plugins needs it.

The following way of writing have changed:

* minus => underscore in keys
* yes/no => true/false
* empty => null
* optionnal => required
* the *option* part is optionnal if not required by the type.

The following items has been added:

* *name* : a human readable name for the configuration item. 

Files part
==========

There is no more *files* part as now the plugin files are contained in the same root directory. So when the package is created, all files are included.

Identity part
=============

The following keys had been removed:

* no more changelog

The following way of writing have changed:

* *category* => *tags*
* *id* => *name*
