Plugins development workflow
============================

.. todo::

    Set the final urls of the packages repository: see xxxxxxxxxxxxx.org

Overview
========

All the released versions of the plugins can be available on the packages repository : xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.org
The developper of a plugin just need to submit its plugin (more details in step 5).

We want to avoid alpha/beta/candidates versions for a plugin : 

* it may be too heavy to handle for some developpers. 
* it will fill the packages repository with non stable plugin releases.

So, we want each developper to release a plugin version only when the plugin release in progress is finished (you will find a checklist of what is expected in the step 5). If some people wish to use a plugin under development, they just need to use the GitHub (or whatever else) repository (more details in the step 4). 

Focus on the branches
=====================

For any Domogik package on git, you should follow the branching model described on this page.
This branching model is inspired from the one here : http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Basically :
* the *master* branch contains the last stable release
* the *develop* branch contains the release which is currently developped. It you have to do any upgrade or fix, you should do them in this branch.
* when a stable release is ready (in the *develop* branch), you create a *tag* (and *version*) on the GitHub repository and then merge it into the master branch.

Example for a new plugin
------------------------

On the left, there is the *master* branch. On the right, the *develop* branch.

Step 1 - prepare the information files on the master branch
===========================================================

:doc:`You will find the links for these actions in the index of the plugin development documentation <index>`

This step goal is to provide at least a README.md file in the master branch to help people find the plugin documentation even if no release has been released (and so the master branch contains no plugin yet).

Step 2 - switch to the develop branch
=====================================

Before coding anything you must switch to the *develop* branch : as the *master* branch content must be the last stable release of your plugin, you must NEVER do any development in this branch (*master*). This branch will be filled only with merge of the *tags* of the stable releases done in the *develop* branch.

First, if this is not already done, commit the changes on the *master* branch (README.md, CHANGELOG, .gitignore) and push them: ::

    $ git status
    ...
            .gitignore
            CHANGELOG
            README.md
    ...
    
    $ git add .gitignore CHANGELOG README.md
    $ git commit -m "Initial commit"
    [master (commit racine) e86b189] Initial commit
    3 files changed, 9 insertions(+)
    ...
    $ git push
    ...
    To git@github.com:fritz-smh/domogik-plugin-teleinfo.git
     * [new branch]      master -> master

At this point, the master branch will only include nearly nothing. This is the goal! The master branch will be populated with the plugin data only when a stable version will be released.

Then, create the new *develop* branch and push it to the remote repository (on GitHub): ::

    $ git branch develop
    $ git checkout develop
    $ git push --set-upstream origin develop
    ...
    To git@github.com:fritz-smh/domogik-plugin-teleinfo.git
     * [new branch]      develop -> develop
    ...

You can now start to develop your plugin on this branch!

When you think your plugin is ready for a stable release, you can read the :doc:`package releasing guide <releasing>`.

Step 3 - Develop the plugin
===========================

:doc:`You will find the links for these actions in the index of the plugin development documentation <index>`

You should stay on this step until a stable version of your plugin is not ready in the *develop* branch.
Please don't forget that a stable version means:

* the plugin is functionnal and stable
* the plugin code is clean
* the info.json file is ok 
* the documentation is written and handled by ReadTheDoc
* if the plugin technology allows it, some tests have been written and are functionnal with Travis CI
* ...

You will find a complete checklist in a later step


Step 4 - Releasing a development version
========================================

Register the plugin the packages repository
-------------------------------------------

A development version (which can be named as alpha/beta/candidate) will never be published on the packages repository as a release. But you can submit the direct link to the zip of the last commit of the branch *develop* on the package repository. This will allow:

* the plugin to be identified as an existing plugin still under development
* display the plugin build status in the packages repository dashboard

.. todo::

    Currently, the package repository does not handle yet this kind of packages. An enhancement is in progress. See https://github.com/fritz-smh/dmgweb_packages/issues/1
    The doc for this step will be finished after this ticket is completed

Step 5 - Releasing a stable version
===================================

The checklist
-------------

Here are all the prerequisites for a plugin to be stable:

* The development of the features included in the plugin version is complete
* The plugin is stable (it has been tested a complete week without any restart)
* The documentation is finished and published on ReadTheDoc
* The tests are written, set with Travis CI and the tests results are OK
* A few people have tested and approved the plugin
* There is no license issue with the code

If one of these points is not OK, the plugin will not be validated on the package repository by the core team.


Prepare the release
-------------------

First, you need to check you have no more upgrades in progress. You can check with the **git status** command.

Then, check that you have pushed all upgrades on the remote repository by doing a last push with the **git push** command. If some commits were not pushed, well... it means that only you have tested the last plugin upgrades and so the checklist is not fully ok ;). Get back later on the step 5 after some people have tested your last upgrades!

Check the *info.json* file is OK : the version set in the identity part of the json file must be set to the version number you want to release. Example for a version 1.0: ::

    "identity": {
        ...
        "name": "teleinfo",
        "type": "plugin",
        "version": "1.0"
    },

If this was not ok, fix this, do a commit, check that the plugin is still starting (if not, you made a mistake in the json file) and push the commit (and not, at this point you don't need other people to test again).

Check all the existing tags for your plugin: ::

    git pull --tags
    git tags -l

Check that there is not already a tag created for the version you want to release. If so well... you are bad somewhere!

Now, set a tag for your release. For example: ::

    git tag -a "1.0"

Push the tag on the remote repository: ::

    git push -tags

And finally, merge the tag in the *master* branch. For example for our 1.0 release: ::

    git checkout master
    git merge 1.0

Push the merge: ::

    git push

And get back to the *develop* branch: ::

    git checkout develop

You now have finished the actions on your local repository!

Check that the Travis CI build is ok for your tag
-------------------------------------------------

Go on the Travis CI page of your plugin and check in the **Branch summary** tab that a build has been done for your tag and is OK (you may need to wait a few minutes if you just pushed the tag). Example for the *teleinfo* plugin: https://travis-ci.org/fritz-smh/domogik-plugin-teleinfo/branches

Get the build status picture url for the release of your plugin and keep it somewhere for the submission. Example url for the *teleinfo* plugin and its release 1.0: https://api.travis-ci.org/fritz-smh/domogik-plugin-teleinfo.svg?branch=1.0


Configure ReadTheDoc to build the new version
---------------------------------------------

.. todo::
    TODO
    And get the doc url :)

Create a release on GitHub
--------------------------

.. todo::
    TODO
    And get the zip url :)

Finally : submit the package!
-----------------------------

.. todo::
    * submitting
