Install Domogik
===============

If you are already a Domogik 0.3 user
=====================================

You must first `install Domogik 0.4.2 release <http://domogik.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.2/enduser/installation/index.html>`_. Then, you will be able to upgrade to Domogik 0.5.

Important notice about the 0.5 release
======================================

In the 0.5 release, the Rest component has been merged in the Admin component. If you were using some user interfaces that uses Rest or any script. Please upgrade them :

* use the admin port (40406) instead of the previous rest port (40405)
* add */rest/* in front of all old Rest url. Example : *http://192.168.1.10:40405/device/* become *http://192.168.1.10:40406/rest/device/*.

Some core butler functions interfaces have changed. **All brain packages must be upgraded to Domogik 0.5 compliant releases.**

If you plan to install Domogik on a Raspberry pi
================================================

If you want to use a Raspberry pi A/B/B+, you should forget to install Domogik on it. Currently Domogik uses too much memory for these models.

Domogik can work fine on a Raspberry pi 2 but some users encountered some performances issues. Please avoid using this platform for now (except for test purpose).

Installation
============

.. note::
    * Domogik includes its own xPL hub.  If you are running another xPL hub on your target machine (xpl-perl, etc), you will have to deactivate it before the installation.
    * In this example, we use a *mysql* database. If you want to use a *postgresql* database, please refer to :doc:`the specific installations steps for postgresql <postgresql>`.

The sudo command
----------------

Some distributions may not include the **sudo** command as a default one. For Debian-based distribution, you can install it by doing as root : ::

    # apt-get install sudo

You can also simply logon as the **root** user and ignore the **sudo** part of the command for the commands that include a **sudo**.

The lsb_release command
-----------------------

Domogik installation script uses the ``lsb_release -si`` command to check which Linux distribution you are using. Some Linux distribution has not this package instlled by default. This is the case for **Raspbian** for example. 

On all Debian-based distributions (Raspbian for example), please install the **lsb-release** package like this: ::

    $ sudo apt-get install lsb-release

On other distributions, please refer to your distribution documentation.

Dependencies 
------------

Check your Python version with the below command: ::

    python -V

.. note::
    Right now Domogik **requires Python 2.7**. Python 3 is not (yet) fully supported.

If you don't already have Python 2.7 or above (you have it if you are running a recent Linux system), please install the following package : 

* python2.7

.. note::
    Example on a Debian based distribution: ::

        $ sudo apt-get install python2.7
        $ sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python

Here are the needed dependencies. depanding on your Linux distribution, they will be installed automatically Debian, Ubuntu) or not.

* the development packages, pip and setuptools : **python2.7-dev, python-pip, python-setuptools**
* SSL libraries : **libssl-dev**
* Zero MQ library : **libzmq-dev >= 14.4**. With the 14.3 release of this library, the publish/subscribe feature will not work!
* postgresql libraries : **libpq-dev, python-psycopg2**
* various needed libraries : **python-mako, libffi-dev, python-netifaces**
* git : **git**
* MySQL server : **mysql-server**
* Sphinx and Sphinx theme : **python-sphinx, sphinx-better-theme**

.. note::
    * Even if you plan to use mysql database instead of postgresql, the *python-psycopg2* package is needed by the *alembic* library.

The **install.py** script will install these dependencies for the following distributions:

* Debian based distributions

For all the other distributions, please install them manually.

Dependencies to install manually
********************************

The **netifaces python library** can't be installed automatically. For now you will have to install it manually. Example for debian based distributions: ::

    $ sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev python-pip
    $ sudo pip install netifaces

In minimum debian repo the package **sphinx-better-theme** does not exist::

    $ sudo pip install sphinx-better-theme

About Debian stable (8.6)
*************************

If you are using a Debian stable, you will need to install a more recent release of the **alembic** package. You can do ::

    $ cd /tmp
    $ wget http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/pool/main/a/alembic/alembic_0.8.8-2_all.deb
    $ sudo dpkg -i alembic_0.8.8-2_all.deb
 

Mysql server
------------

.. note::
    * If you have already a Mysql server installed, you will only have to create the Domogik database.
    * Please note that Domogik does not automatically install the mysql server.
    * If you choose to manually create the database, it is highly recommended to use the **innodb engine** (which can be enabled in /etc/mysql/my.cnf)

Install the packages for mysql server: ::

    $ sudo apt-get install mysql-server

During the installation, **Domogik will automatically create the database**, but if you want to create the database yourself, log on the mysql database as root user: ::

    $ mysql -u root -p
    Enter password: 

Create a database called *domogik* and add grants on it to the user *domogik*: ::

    CREATE DATABASE domogik;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON domogik.* to domogik@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'domopass';


Download Domogik components
---------------------------

.. note::
    The following commands assume that you are using the **/opt/dmg/** folder as the root folder for Domogik. And so Domogik will be installed in the */opt/dmg/domogik/* folder.
    If you choose another folder, please keep in mind the below points:

    * You must put Domogik sources in a folder which can be read by all the system users and the domogik user. For example, be careful if you extract domogik sources in */home/john/domogik* and you choose the *domogik* user during installation : the *domogik* user must have write access to */home/john/domogik*.
    * Don't download Domogik sources directly in */root* or */*
    * The folder path must also not contains any spaces in its name!



Two components are needed to install domogik : 

* **domogik-mq** : the message queue component used by all components which want/need to use the message queue (Domogik, Domoweb, ...)
* **domogik**

Git is used to get the sources (be sure that your user is able to create some directories where you will clone the sources).


Create the folder */opt/dmg/* : ::

    $ sudo mkdir -p /opt/dmg
    $ sudo useradd -M domogik
    $ sudo chown domogik /opt/dmg  # assuming the user domogik already exists!
    $ sudo chmod 777 /opt/dmg

.. note::
    About Domogik 0.5 database upgrade.

    * the following action may take some time : **INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade 2e6c120aa69a -> a2a3015badf, Upgrade float precission**: it will affect all the history table, so it may take a while to run! Don't worry if this is very long, just wait for the end ;)


.. note::

    * Domogik uses a configuration file which is created and configured by the *install.py* script. This file is */etc/domogik/domogik.cfg*. For more informations, please read :doc:`the page related to the configuration file <domogik_cfg_file>`.
    * If you want to use the C xPL hub instead of the python xPL hub, you need to update manually the configuration after Domogik installation. You can check the technical documentation for more informations about configuring the xPL Hub.



In case you keep your old Domogik 0.4.0 configuration file **/etc/domogik/domogik.cfg**, you will have to complete it with these lines for Domogik 0.4.2 : ::

    [butler]
    name = Aria
    lang = fr_FR
    sex = female
    
    [backup]
    folder = /opt/dmg/backup

    [metrics]
    id = some_random_id_of_your_choice
    url = http://metrics.domogik.org/


And you will also have to replace the below line value (use a network interface name instead of an ip address). Example: ::

    bind_interface = eth0,lo

Butler section : 

* The **name** is your butler name, use the name you want.
* The **lang** is your language : fr_FR, en_US, ...
* The **sex** is related to the name you choosed : male, female

Backup section : 

* The **folder** location is the place in which all domogik data will be backuped (database, configuration files, etc).

Metrics section : 

* The **id** should be some anonymous id. 
* The **url** must not be changed.

If you are wondering what metrics are, please check the :doc:`note about metrics in the 0.5.0 release note </users/releases/0.5.0>`.

Make Domogik start with your computer
-------------------------------------

For Debian or Ubuntu systems: ::

    $ sudo update-rc.d domogik defaults

Start domogik
-------------

::

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/domogik start
    * Starting 0MQ broker ... Done.
    * Starting 0MQ forwarder ... Done.
    * Starting xPL (python version)... Done.
    * Starting Manager (with -d -r -x -s)... Done.
    * Starting the admin interface ... Done.

It will start : 

* The 0MQ broker and forwarder
* The xpl hub
* The Domogik manager on this host
* The database manager and the REST interface module (which will take in account the parameters you defined in your configuration file : host, IP...)
* The administration web interface

.. note::
    Domogik administration is available on http://<ip>:40406/ if you didn't change the port number.

    Default **login** and **password** are : 

    * login : admin
    * password : 123

Set up the automatic backup  and packages documentation automatic upgrade
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want (and you should), you could configure a daily (or weekly) backup. Domogik provides a python backup script : **backup.py**. 

To use it, edit your crontab file: ::

    crontab -e

And add at the end the below lines: ::

    # Domogik backup each night at 1:00
    0 1 * * * /opt/dmg/domogik/backup.py > /var/log/domogik/backup-$(date "+\%Y\%m\%d_\%H\%M").log 2>&1
    # Domogik : regenerate packages documentation each hour
    0 * * * * /opt/dmg/domogik/src/domogik/bin/package.py -d >> /var/log/domogik/refresh_docs_pkg-$(date "+\%Y\%m\%d").log 2>&1

The default backup folder is **/var/lib/domogik/backup/**. You can change it in the file **/etc/domogik/domogik.cfg** in the section **[backup]**. Example: ::

    ###
    # Backup configuration
    ###
    [backup]
    folder=/var/lib/domogik/backup/



Next step : install and use a user interface
--------------------------------------------

You can use either Domoweb or Domodroid to control your home.

* `Domoweb <http://domoweb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
* `Domodroid <http://domodroid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

It doesn't work?
