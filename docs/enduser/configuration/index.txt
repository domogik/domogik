====================
First use of Domogik
====================

Purpose
=======
In this page we will present you the different screens and sections of Domogik. If you already use Domogik you can directly go to ((Create_and_configure_your_house|the next page)).

Accessing to the Domogik web UI
===============================
At the end of the installation the installer script should have displayed this information :

* Administrator login
* Administrator password
* Domogik web UI url

So you should be now able to access to the Domogik web UI :)

Screens description
===================
Home screen description
-----------------------
The first time you access Domogik you should see an information notification which tells you that there is no area or room yet created :

.. image:: no_area_or_room.png

.. todo:: screenshot with no data

.. todo:: screenshot with data

On the top of the screen you will get :

* **Domogik banner**.
* **Main menu**.

Under the main menu there are :

* On the left, the **widgets zone** of the house.
* On the right, the **different places** of your house ordered by areas. If you get rooms directly linked to your house they will appear before areas.

Menu
^^^^

* Visualization : go to visualization screen. 
* Administration : go to administration section.
* Help : direct link to this Domogik online documentation.
* Connect/Disconnect : Login or logout from Domogik. Currently (in ((Release0.1.0|release 0.1.0))), login is needed only to access the administration part.

Visualization screen
--------------------
On the top there will always be a **navigation menu**. 

.. image:: navbar.png

On the left you will see where you are in your house : *House > Area > Room*.
Clicking on one of them will get you to the associated Visualization screen. Clicking on the Domogik logo will get you to the Home screen.

On the right there are two buttons :

* Customize : allows you to choose widgets and arrange them on the current screen.
* Menu : it will display the menu bar (the same than for the Home screen).
