===============================
Test runner for Domogik plugins
===============================

Purpose
=======

The test runner tool is used by continous integration to run a set of test files for a plugin.

How it works ?
==============

You just need to give the tool the path to the test files and it will use the *tests.json* file to execute some test files depending on the parameters you give to the tool.

Here are all the available options: ::

    $ ./testrunner.py -h
    usage: testrunner.py [-h] [-a] [-c CRITICITY] directory
    
    Launch all the tests that don't need hardware.
    
    positional arguments:
      directory             What directory to run
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -a, --allow-alter     Launch the tests that can alter the configuration of
                            the plugin or the setup (devices, ...)
      -c CRITICITY, --criticity CRITICITY
                            Set the minimum level of criticity to use to filter
                            the tests to execute. low/medium/high. Default is low.

* --allow-alter : you must use this option with caution! It will allow to run all the tests that alter the Domogik system (change the configuration, delete and create some devices, ...). **This must NOT be used on a production environment!**
* --critivity <level> : set the mimimum level of criticity that will be used. If set to *high*, only the tests tagged as *high* criticity in the json file will be run.


Example
=======

In this example, there is only one test file to lauch, which is named *tests*. ::

    $ ./testrunner.py -a -c low /var/lib/domogik/domo
    gik_packages/plugin_diskfree/tests/
    Domogik release : 0.4.0
    Running test with the folowing parameters:
    - allow to alter the configuration or setup.
    - criticity : low
    - path /var/lib/domogik/domogik_packages/plugin_diskfree/tests/
    - json file /var/lib/domogik/domogik_packages/plugin_diskfree/tests//tests.json
    List of the tests (keep in mind that tests which need hardware will be skipped) :
    [ TO RUN  ] tests : need hardware=False, alter config or setup=True, criticity=high
