Purpose
=======

The **0.5.2 release** is a minor release which includes some fixes about the 0.5.1 release.


Improvments
===========

* #430 - Butler is slow to respond to some queries. This one is quite important as it **breakds the compliance with some packages**. The list of the packages to update is in the installation note.
* The DT_Battery and DT_Humidity datatypes which are percentages are moved from DT_Number childs to DT_Scaling childs. This way, all DT_Scaling related features can be applyied to these datatypes.
