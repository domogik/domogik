info.json for plugins - sensors section
=======================================

Purpose
=======

The sensors section will quickly describe each sensor with:

* a name
* a data type. See :doc:`the data types documentation <../../../technical/data_types/index>` for more informations
* if needed, some conversion options


Example 1
=========

This example is the *diskfree* plugin. See the :doc:`device types documentation <device_types>` for more informations.

For each sensor, we define a name and no conversion option. Then, depending of the sensor we use 2 data types:

* DT_Byte : this one is used for values in byte, which are the values returned by the sensors *get_free_space*, *get_used_space* and *get_total_space*.
* DT_Scaling is used for values in percent from 0 to 100, which corresponds to the value returned by the sensor *get_percent_used*.

                    "store": true,

                    "max": 0,
                    "expire": 0,
                    "round_value": 0
                }
            },
            ...
        }

Description
===========

Each item has several properties: 

* **name** : it is a string used to display this sensor on the UI
* **data_type** : the data type used for this sensor
* **incremental** : if set to True, store the difference between the last value and the current value, check the incremental section for more info.
* **timeout** : this is just an information which could be used by user interfaces to notify if a value is too old (this may indicate that the sensor is down/offline/broken. This is a value in *seconds*. If the value is 0, then we consider there is no issue if the last value is very old. 
* **conversion** : if not an empty string, what conversion function to call before storing the value in the db, the function should return the data in the format acording to the data_type. More informations in the :doc:`conversion chapter </package_development/plugins/conversion/index>`.
* **history** : some extra parameters that can be used to define what to store in the history table
    * **store** : can be True or False, if True the values will be stored in the sensor_history table
    * **max** : max number of records that will be stored in the history table, if 0 the max number is infinate.
    * **expire** : how long the history needs to be kept, if 0 the stats will bekept forever. Its counted in days, so a value of 10 means keep the history for 10 days.
    * **round_value** : a number that will be used for the reduced stats storage. This will only be evaluated if tstore is True
    * **duplicate** : if set to true, duplicate values following each other will be stored, if set to false this will not happen

.. note::
    The values in the subsection history can be adapted after sensor creation, the changes will be visible in the sensor_history table once a new value is stored for that sensor.

.. note::
    If a sensor is set as incremental its not a good idea to set round_value to anythign different then 0. This could result in corrupt data in the sensor_history table.

What happens if a sensor value needs to be store
================================================

A couple of steps are taken during sensor lookups, they are described below:

  1. First check if we can match the xpl source to a known plugin
  2. Search for a matching xpl_stat message thats stored in the db (can be multiple)
  3. Record all sensors + the value to store per xpl_stat
  4. For every sensor/value pair check if the value is in the ignore_values, go to step 11
  5. For every sensor/value pair run the :doc:`conversion function </package_development/plugins/conversion/index>` if defined
  6. For every sensor/value pair handle the incremental field if needed, value = <received value> - <last stored value>
  7. For every sensor/value pair handle the duplicate field if needed
  8. For every sensor/value pair handle the formula if needed
  9. For every sensor/value pair handle the round value
  10. for every sensor/value store the value if sensor.store is set
  11. Send an mq pub message device-stats with the device id, sensor id and the value

Incremental explanation
=======================
The parameter is used for sensors like a kWH sensor, these sensors typically send over an absolute value, if we would store this value we would just get a climing chart, so the charts would not be representative. To solve this we intruduced the incremental sensor type.

This means that only the difference between the last stored value will be stored, to explain it exactly w'll work with an example.

For a sensor that has incremental set tue, the following values are received:
1. 10
2. 11
3. 12
4. 15
5. 16
6. 18

So on the receival of the first value, incremental will just keep this value in memory, so it can calculate the diffrence on the next received values.

On step 2 we will store the difference between the value received on step 1 and the one received in step 2, so we will store 1.
The same happens on all the next steps. As a result we will get the folowing stored values:
1. 0
2. 1
3. 1
4. 3
5. 1
6. 2

This will result in a chart that will really display the used kWH during the time period between the 2 steps.

Round Value explanation
=======================
The round value is used to reduce the number of stored history values.

As an example why this would be needed:
Some device can collect data every 10 seconds, in 24 hours, the device can collect 8640 items a day. If we have 10 such a devices it would result in 86400 items a day or 2678400 items a week. This would be to much data and is not usefull. To solve this problem we introduced the round_value key. Basically the round_value key will delete values that fall within a predefined range. An example explains this the best:

Below is a list of received values from a sensor:
1. 10
2. 11
3. 12
4. 9
5. 15
6. 16
7. 18
8. 19
9. 20

So lets see wath will happend if round_value is set to 2:

On step 1 and 2 the round value will do nothing as it needs at least 2 stored values to work.
On step 3 the round value will do its first action, it will see that the difference between value from step 1 is smaller or equal to round_value key, meaning that it will delete the value received in step 2.
On setp 4 it will kick in action again, at this point the data in the table is the folowing
* 10
* 12
The received value is 9, as the round_value is set to 2, it will not delete anything.
The same happend is step 5 and 6.
On step 7 the difference is again <= round_value, so the value received in step 6 is deleted.
So if we see whta data we will ahve after value 9 is received:

* 10
* 12
* 9
* 15
* 18
* 20

In this example this will save use 66% of storage space, so for the example in the beginning of this section we will go from 2678400 items a week to 1767744 items a week.

For this sytem to work its verry important that the round_value is set to a logical number for that type of sensor.
