* General
	* @Loiz : set up internationalization for messages (see also how to translate data
		stored in the DB)
		For Django, see : http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/#topics-i18n

* UI
	* @Epy : create a prototype using HTML / CSS
		Only two files to edit : base.html and style.css !

	* Control
		* @Maxence : integrate code to send commands over the xPL network (in views.py)
		* @Marc : Display history of readings (essentially for sensors)
			Seems to be a good idea to use the powerful rrdtools : http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/gallery/index.en.html
		* @? : Add a function to schedule a task (eg. switch on/off the heating at a given time)

	* Admin
		* @Marc : Add inline help to explain what are device properties)
		* @Marc : Add localization of the installation (Zip, City, Country) : useful for wheather forecasts

	* Model
		* @Marc : no need to have tables for capacities and technologies, simply use a static list instead
			If you add a technology for example, you'll have to change the code...
		* @Marc : in the technology list, add a "script" type : it will allow us to use a technology that is not part of Domogik yet.
			The address of the device would contain in this case the path to the script.

	* General coding
		* @Marc : check that the app is working with sqlite DB
		* @?	: check that the app is working properly with either mod_python or Django's embedded server
		* @?	: Using iso8859-15 on his machine, somebody reported this error :
			UnicodeDecodeError at /domogik/
			The string that could not be encoded/decoded was:  13 d�c 2008)
		* @? : find a way to switch between pure links and icons for the clickable areas (menus, functions...)
		* @? : Add facility to save / load scenes 

		* @Marc :
			* Put 'isAdminMode' variable in a session value 
				(avoid reading it each time from the db, having to put it in a request variable each time)

		* @Marc :
			* Use paginator to display items on a page (devices, logs, ...).
				See : http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/pagination/#topics-pagination

		* @? :
			* Add integration tests (See : http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/testing/#topics-testing)

* mpris
	* @Maxence : create Mpris API in Python
    * @Maxence : create Mpris support to MPD (using python dbus/mpd libs)

* xPL
	* @Maxence : create fake components that simulate a real home automation network
		(useful to test the app without having any home automation installation)

* Website
	* @? : complete technical section
		* Write articles presenting the different technologies that can be used in home automation (X10, 1-Wire, PLCBus, IR, RFXCom, ...).
			The aim is just to give an overview and not an exhaustive documentation.
	* @Marc : make sure articles are displayed in the right order
	* @Alban or @Marc : complete the "About us" section listing the main people managing / contributing to the project, and create other membrers profile
	@ ? : Add screenshots of the new UI
